To complete the practices in this course, you MUST access SAS Software and set up the practice files. See the README file in the DataSetup folder.

===============================================================
Practicing in SAS
The name of the practice file corresponds to the chapter title. Some chapters do not have practice files. Typically, each practice file has 3 levels: 
     In Level 1 practices you solve basic problems with step-by-step guidance. 
     In Level 2 practices you solve intermediate problems with defined goals but a little less guidance.
     In Challenge-level practices you solve complex problems that might require you to use SAS Help. 
All practices have a complete solution PDF that you can check at anytime. You can choose the level and you do not have to do all three levels.
