Practicing in SAS
The name of the practice file corresponds to the chapter title. Some chapters do not have practice files. 

Typically, each practice file has 3 levels. You can select the level you want to do - you do not have to do all 3 levels.
 
     In Level 1 practices you solve basic problems with step-by-step guidance. 
     In Level 2 practices you solve intermediate problems with defined goals but a little less guidance.
     In Challenge-level practices you solve complex problems that might require you to use SAS Help. 

All practices have a complete solution PDF that you can check at anytime.
